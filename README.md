# AIhealthcarechatbot
•	This project is created to deliver personalized experiences to the patients for identifying the illness, scheduling doctor appointments, notifying caregivers about symptoms, monitoring the health status, update the homecare assistant from time-to-time and more with the use of a chatbot.
•	Through chatbots one can communicate with text or voice interface and get a reply through artificial intelligence.
•	Typically, a chatbot will communicate with a real person.
•	These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment.
•	Chatbots typically provide a text-based user interface, allowing the user to type commands and receive responses. Including the features of a chatbot, we are going to developed a healthcare chatbot, which is a web-based application used for both interactions as well as discussion and to get some important information.
•	Patients can Sign up and Log in using the portal, later they can chat using the “Forum”, where they can share their symptoms and get information regarding that. They can book an appointment with a doctor, availability of doctors, etc. This will create an environment to conduct and get reviews.
•	A user just has to query through the bot which is used for chatting. If the answer found to be valid will get the response according to it, the admin can view the responses. If the response is not found for the following keyword then it will generate appropriate error messages.
•	The user can query about different symptoms they can recognize and do the further process online with this application.
•	This will keep patients, doctors updated.
